Figlet Forge extends the original pyfiglet package (itself a pure Python port of FIGlet)
with robust support for colorized ANSI codes, full Unicode character rendering,
an expanded font ecosystem, and intelligent fallback mechanisms for seamless
compatibility with older systems. This reimplementation delivers significant
improvements in performance, maintainability, documentation, and extensibility
while ensuring complete backward compatibility.
